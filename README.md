# iml-hack-oncology

This project was built during the 48-hour IML Hackathon 2025 as an end-to-end clinical-AI pipeline: it ingests a patient’s raw electronic medical record, automatically cleans and harmonises dozens of heterogeneous fields, engineers temporal and biological features, and then feeds the result into an ensemble of gradient-boosted trees and neural networks. Within seconds the system returns two actionable outputs—(1) the overall probability that the patient currently has cancer and (2) the most likely cancer subtype or metastasis profile—helping clinicians prioritise tests and treatments. All models were trained on a large, real-world, de-identified hospital dataset, and the repository includes reproducible data-processing scripts, training code, and a one-command packaging step that produces a ready-to-deploy bundle, demonstrating full ownership of data engineering, machine-learning, and lightweight MLOps.
